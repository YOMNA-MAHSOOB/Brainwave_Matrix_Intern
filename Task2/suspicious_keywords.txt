Each of the following keywords may indicate potentially harmful behavior in a script or program:

- subprocess â†’ Runs external commands
- eval â†’ Evaluates a string as code (can run arbitrary code)
- exec â†’ Executes Python code dynamically
- pickle â†’ Can execute arbitrary code when loading data
- base64 â†’ Often used to hide or obfuscate payloads
- socket â†’ Used for network connections (can be used for C2)

- http:// or https:// â†’ Indicates internet communication
- open("/dev/tcp/") â†’ Raw socket access in shell (Linux backdoor behavior)
